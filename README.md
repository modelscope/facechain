# Introduction

如果您熟悉中文，可以阅读[中文版本的README](./README_ZH.md)。

FaceChain is a novel framework for generating identity-preserved human portraits. In the newest FaceChain FACT (Face Adapter with deCoupled Training) version, with only 1 photo and 10 seconds, you can generate personal portraits in different settings (multiple styles now supported!). FaceChain has both high controllability and authenticity in portrait generation, including text-to-image and inpainting based pipelines, and is seamlessly compatible with ControlNet and LoRAs. You may generate portraits via FaceChain's Python scripts, or via the familiar Gradio interface, or via sd webui. 
FaceChain is powered by [ModelScope](https://github.com/modelscope/modelscope).

# Script Execution

FaceChain supports direct inference in the python environment. When inferring for Infinite Style Portrait generation, please edit the code in run_inference.py:

```python
# Use pose control, default False
use_pose_model = False
# The path of the input image containing ID information for portrait generation
input_img_path = 'poses/man/pose2.png'
# The path of the image for pose control, only effective when using pose control
pose_image = 'poses/man/pose1.png'
# The number of images to generate in inference
num_generate = 5
# The weight for the style model, see styles for detail
multiplier_style = 0.25
# Specify a folder to save the generated images, this parameter can be modified as needed
output_dir = './generated'
# The index of the chosen base model, see facechain/constants.py for detail
base_model_idx = 0
# The index of the style model, see styles for detail
style_idx = 0
```

Then execute:

```shell
python run_inference.py
```

You can find the generated personal digital image photos in the `output_dir`.

When inferring for Fixed Templates Portrait generation, please edit the code in run_inference_inpaint.py.

```python
# Number of faces for the template image
num_faces = 1
# Index of face for inpainting, counting from left to right
selected_face = 1
# The strength for inpainting, you do not need to change the parameter
strength = 0.6
# The path of the template image
inpaint_img = 'poses/man/pose1.png'
# The path of the input image containing ID information for portrait generation
input_img_path = 'poses/man/pose2.png'

# Algorithm Introduction

The capability of AI portraits generation comes from the large generative models like Stable Diffusion and its fine-tuning techniques. Due to the strong generalization capability of large models, it is possible to perform downstream tasks by fine-tuning on specific types of data and tasks, while preserving the model's overall ability of text following and image generation. The technical foundation of train-based and train-free AI portraits generation comes from applying different fine-tuning tasks to generative models. Currently, most existing AI portraits tools adopt a two-stage “train then generate” pipeline, where the fine-tuning task is “to generate portrait photos of a fixed character ID”, and the corresponding training data are multiple images of the fixed character ID. The effectiveness of such train-based pipeline depends on the scale of the training data, thus requiring certain image data support and training time, which also increases the cost for users.

Different from train-based pipeline, train-free pipeline adjusts the fine-tuning task to “generate portrait photos of a specified character ID”, meaning that the character ID image (face photo) is used as an additional input, and the output is a portrait photo preserving the input ID. Such a pipeline completely separates offline training from online inference, allowing users to generate portraits directly based on the fine-tuned model with only one photo in just 10 seconds, avoiding the cost for extensive data and training time. The fine-tuning task of train-free AI portraits generation is based on the adapter module. Face photos are processed through an image encoder with fixed weights and a parameter-efficient feature projection layer to obtain aligned features, and are then fed into the U-Net model of Stable Diffusion through attention mechanism similar as text conditions. At this point, face information as an independent branch condition is fed into the model alongside text information for inference, thereby enabling the generated images to maintain ID fidelity.

The basic algorithm based on face adapter is capable of achieving train-free AI portraits, but still requires certain adjustments to further improve its effectiveness. Existing train-free portrait tools generally suffer from the following issues: poor image quality of portraits, inadequate text following and style retention abilities in portraits, poor controllability and richness of portrait faces, and poor compatibility with extensions like ControlNet and style Lora. To address these issues, FaceChain attribute them to the fact that the fine-tuning tasks for existing train-free AI portrait tools have coupled with too much information beyond character IDs, and propose FaceChain Face Adapter with Decoupled Training (FaceChain FACT) to solve these problems. By fine-tuning the Stable Diffusion model on millions of portrait data, FaceChain FACT can achieve high-quality portrait image generation for specified character IDs. The entire framework of FaceChain FACT is shown in the figure below.

![image](resources/framework.png)

The decoupled training of FaceChain FACT consists of two parts: decoupling face from image, and decoupling ID from face. Existing methods often treat denoising portrait images as the fine-tuning task, which makes the model hard to accurately focus on the face area, thereby affecting the text-to-image ability of the base Stable Diffusion model. FaceChain FACT draws on the sequential processing and regional control advantages of face-swapping algorithms and implements the fine-tuning method for decoupling faces from images from both structural and training strategy aspects. Structurally, unlike existing methods that use a parallel cross-attention mechanism to process face and text information, FaceChain FACT adopts a sequential processing approach as an independent adapter layer inserted into the original Stable Diffusion's blocks. This way, face adaptation acts as an independent step similar to face-swapping during the denoising process, avoiding interference between face and text conditions. In terms of training strategy, besides the original MSE loss function, FaceChain FACT introduces the Face Adapting Incremental Regularization (FAIR) loss function, which controls the feature increment of the face adaptation step in the adapter layer to focus on the face region. During inference, users can flexibly adjust the generated effects by modifying the weight of the face adapter, balancing fidelity and generalization of the face while maintaining the text-to-image ability of Stable Diffusion. The FAIR loss function is formulated as follows:

![image](resources/FAIR.png)

Furthermore, addressing the issue of poor controllability and richness of generated faces, FaceChain FACT proposes a training method for decoupling ID from face, so that the portrait process only preserves the character ID rather than the entire face. Firstly, to better extract the ID information from the face while maintaining certain key facial details, and to better adapt to the structure of Stable Diffusion, FaceChain FACT employs a face feature extractor based on the Transformer architecture, which is pre-trained on a large-scale face dataset. All tokens from the penultimate layer are subsequently fed into a simple attention query model for feature projection, thereby ensuring that the extracted ID features meet the aforementioned requirements. Additionally, during the training process, FaceChain FACT uses the Classifier Free Guidance (CFG) method to perform random shuffle and drop for different portrait images of the same ID, thus ensuring that the input face images and the target images used for denoising may have different faces with the same ID, thus further preventing the model from overfitting to non-ID information of the face. As such, FaceChain FACT possesses high compatibility with the massive exquisite styles of FaceChain, which is shown as follows.
