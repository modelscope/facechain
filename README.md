# Script Execution

FaceChain supports direct training and inference in the python environment. Run the following command in the cloned folder to start training:

```shell
PYTHONPATH=. sh train_lora.sh "ly261666/cv_portrait_model" "v2.0" "film/film" "./imgs" "./processed" "./output"
```

Parameters description:

```text
ly261666/cv_portrait_model: The stable diffusion base model of the ModelScope model hub, which will be used for training, no need to be changed.
v2.0: The version number of this base model, no need to be changed
film/film: This base model may contains multiple subdirectories of different styles, currently we use film/film, no need to be changed
./imgs: This parameter needs to be replaced with the actual value. It means a local file directory that contains the original photos used for training and generation
./processed: The folder of the processed images after preprocessing, this parameter needs to be passed the same value in inference, no need to be changed
./output: The folder where the model weights stored after training, no need to be changed
```

Wait for 5-20 minutes to complete the training. Users can also adjust other training hyperparameters. The hyperparameters supported by training can be viewed in the file of `train_lora.sh`, or the complete hyperparameter list in `facechain/train_text_to_image_lora.py`.

When inferring, please edit the code in run_inference.py:

```python
# Use depth control, default False, only effective when using pose control
use_depth_control = False
# Use pose control, default False
use_pose_model = False
# The path of the image for pose control, only effective when using pose control
pose_image = 'poses/man/pose1.png'
# Fill in the folder of the images after preprocessing above, it should be the same as during training
processed_dir = './processed'
# The number of images to generate in inference
num_generate = 5
# The stable diffusion base model used in training, no need to be changed
base_model = 'ly261666/cv_portrait_model'
# The version number of this base model, no need to be changed
revision = 'v2.0'
# This base model may contains multiple subdirectories of different styles, currently we use film/film, no need to be changed
base_model_sub_dir = 'film/film'
# The folder where the model weights stored after training, it must be the same as during training
train_output_dir = './output'
# Specify a folder to save the generated images, this parameter can be modified as needed
output_dir = './generated'
# Use Chinese style model, default False
use_style = False
```

Then execute:

```shell
python run_inference.py
```

You can find the generated personal digital image photos in the `output_dir`.

# Algorithm Introduction

## Architectural Overview

The ability of the personal portrait generation evolves around the text-to-image capability of Stable Diffusion model. We consider the main factors that affect the generation effect of personal portraits: portrait style information and user character information. For this, we use the style LoRA model trained offline and the face LoRA model trained online to learn the above information. LoRA is a fine-tuning model with fewer trainable parameters. In Stable Diffusion, the information of the input image can be injected into the LoRA model by the way of text generation image training with a small amount of input image. Therefore, the ability of the personal portrait model is divided into training and inference stages. The training stage generates image and text label data for fine-tuning the Stable Diffusion model, and obtains the face LoRA model. The inference stage generates personal portrait images based on the face LoRA model and style LoRA model.

## Training

Input: User-uploaded images that contain clear face areas

Output: Face LoRA model

Description: First, we process the user-uploaded images using an image rotation model based on orientation judgment and a face refinement rotation method based on face detection and keypoint models, and obtain images containing forward faces. Next, we use a human body parsing model and a human portrait beautification model to obtain high-quality face training images. Afterwards, we use a face attribute model and a text annotation model, combined with tag post-processing methods, to generate fine-grained labels for training images. Finally, we use the above images and label data to fine-tune the Stable Diffusion model to obtain the face LoRA model.

## Inference

Input: User-uploaded images in the training phase, preset input prompt words for generating personal portraits

Output: Personal portrait image

Description: First, we fuse the weights of the face LoRA model and style LoRA model into the Stable Diffusion model. Next, we use the text generation image function of the Stable Diffusion model to preliminarily generate personal portrait images based on the preset input prompt words. Then we further improve the face details of the above portrait image using the face fusion model. The template face used for fusion is selected from the training images through the face quality evaluation model. Finally, we use the face recognition model to calculate the similarity between the generated portrait image and the template face, and use this to sort the portrait images, and output the personal portrait image that ranks first as the final output result.
